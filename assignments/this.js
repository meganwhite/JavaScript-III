/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global object binding: In the global scope, the object "this" refers to is the console
* 2. Implicit binding: When a function follows a dot, "this" refers to the object before the dot
* 3. New binding: When a constructor function (a function that returns an object) is used, "this" refers to the instance of the object created and returned by the constructor function
* 4. Explicit binding: When "apply" or "call" is used, "this" is explicitly given an object to reference
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
